## Opinion Dynamics

Opinion dynamics is a field of study within the realm of complex systems and sociophysics that explores how opinions, beliefs, and attitudes evolve and spread within social networks. It combines elements of physics, social science, and mathematics to understand the mechanisms driving opinion formation and change under various influences, such as personal convictions, peer pressure, media impact, and societal norms. Our work contributes to this interdisciplinary field by providing robust tools for simulation and analysis, aiding in the understanding of complex opinion dynamics phenomena.
